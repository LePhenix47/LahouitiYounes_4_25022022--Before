This repo contains the 4th OpenClassroom's project
They gave me the code of the website


In this website there a lot of problems, especially with its accessibility and search engine optimisation.

There are A LOT of other problems (excluding the use of Bootstrap which is a cardinal sin, especially knowining that it's a small project) such as the design of the UI but I won't be focusing on fixing that

You'll see the optimised version of this website on the repository named "LahouitiYounes_4_25022022--After"
